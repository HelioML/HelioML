Abstract
As societal dependence on trans-ionospheric radio signals grows, understanding the impact of space weather on these signals is both increasingly important and remains unresolved. The challenge is particularly acute at high-latitudes where the effects of space weather are most direct and no reliable predictive capability exists. We take advantage of a large volume of data from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals, increasingly sophisticated tools for data-driven discovery, and a machine learning algorithm known as the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to develop a novel predictive model for high-latitude ionospheric phase scintillation. This work, to our knowledge, represents the first time a SVM model has been created to predict high-latitude phase scintillation. We define a metric known as the Total Skill Score (TSS), which can be used to robustly compare between predictive methods, to evaluate the SVM model, thereby establishing a benchmark for high-latitude ionospheric phase scintillation. We find that the SVM model significantly outperforms persistence, doubling the predictive skill according to the TSS for a one hour predictive task. The increase in is even more pronounced as prediction time is increased. For a prediction time of three hours, persistence prediction is comparable to a random chance prediction, suggesting that the 'memory' of the ionosphere in terms of high-latitude plasma irregularities is on the order of or shorter than hours. The SVM model predictive skill only slightly decreases between the one and three hour predictive task, pointing to the potential of this method. Our findings can serve as a foundation on which to evaluate future predictive models, a critical development toward the resolution of space weather impact on trans-ionospheric radio signals.
