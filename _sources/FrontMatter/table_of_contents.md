Table of Contents
=================

In the following chapters, we'll cover examples from active research. Each chapter provides the motivation for the research and all of the code necessary to reproduce the results of a paper published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. These chapters cover a variety of topics, but they all employ machine learning methods to heliophysics, which includes the study of the Sun and its effects on our solar system -- the Earth, planets, minor objects, and all of the space in between. 

Below is a short summary of each chapter. Each summary gives a brief overview of the machine learning methods and data types involved in solving a specific research problem. Each ">" symbol is designed to drill down from a general idea into a specific one. If some of these terms don't make sense, don't worry! Acronyms are defined at the bottom and the chapters explain each scientific and machine learning concept in detail.
