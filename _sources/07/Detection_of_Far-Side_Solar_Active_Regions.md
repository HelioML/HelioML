Detection of Far-Side Solar Active Regions
==========================================

*by T. Felipe and A. Asensio Ramos*

Local helioseismology techniques allow the detection of active regions in the non-visible solar hemisphere (far-side) by analyzing the oscillations in the visible side of the Sun. However, this identification is challenged by the low signal-to-noise of the seismic data, and only strong active regions can be reliably detected. 

In this notebook, we will show a method to improve the detection of active regions in far-side seismic maps using a machine learning algorithm.
