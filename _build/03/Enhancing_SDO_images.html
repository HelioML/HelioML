<p><em>by C. J. Diaz Baso and A. Asensio Ramos</em></p>
<p>In this chapter we will learn how to use and apply deep learning tecniques to improve the resolution of our images in a fast and robust way. We have developed a deep fully convolutional neural network which deconvolves and super-resolves continuum images and magnetograms observed with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) satellite. This improvement allow us to analyze the smallest-scale events in the solar atmosphere.</p>
<p>We want to note that although almost all the examples/images are written in python, we have omitted some materials in their original format (usually large FITS files) to avoid increasing the size of this notebook.</p>
<p>The software resulting from this project, which was developed with the python library <a href="https://keras.io/">keras</a>, is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/cdiazbas/enhance">Github</a> and published in <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2018/06/aa31344-17.pdf">DÃ­az Baso &amp; Asensio Ramos, 2018, <i> Astronomy & Astrophysics</i>, 614, A5</a>.</p>
