<h1 id="Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements<a class="anchor-link" href="#Acknowledgements"> </a></h1><p>We built this book on a mountain of incredibly useful open-source tools. The source code for this book converts a collection of Jupyter notebooks (<a href="http://ebooks.iospress.nl/publication/42900">Kluyver et al., 2016</a>) and markdown files into a static website using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Readers can modify and execute code within this book by clicking on the "Interact" button at the top of each chapter (thanks to <a href="https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">BinderHub</a> and a grant from the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform</a>).</p>
<p>Two other textbooks, both developed using open-source software, inspired this book. One is UC Berkeley's Data 8 course textbook, <a href="https://www.inferentialthinking.com/">Computational and Inferential Thinking</a>, by Ani Adhikari and John DeNero. The other is <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10159.html">Statistics, Data Mining, and Machine Learning in Astronomy</a> by Željko Ivezić, Andrew J. Connolly, Jacob T. VanderPlas and Alexander Gray, which is a companion textbook to the <a href="http://www.astroml.org/">AstroML</a> python package by <a href="http://www.astroml.org/index.html#citing-astroml">VanderPlas et al., 2012</a>.</p>
<p>This book was built using a <a href="https://jupyter.org/jupyter-book/guide/01_overview.html">workflow</a> developed by Sam Lau and Chris Holdgraf with support from the Data Science Education Program and the Berkeley Institute for Data Science at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>We'd like to thank Ani Adhikari, Chris Holdgraf, and Jacob VanderPlas, as well as Scott Bailey and Javier de la Rosa from the <a href="https://library.stanford.edu/research/cidr">Stanford University Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research</a>, Erik Tollerud from the <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/">Space Telescope Science Institute</a> and <a href="http://www.astropy.org/">Astropy Project</a>, and Eric Jonas from the <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/">Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department</a> at UC Berkeley for their valuable conversation, guidance, and encouragement.</p>
