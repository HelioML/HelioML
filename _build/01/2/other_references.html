Each author here has obtained their knowledge through other references and through experience. The latter is hard earned but we can easily share some of the former.</p>

<li>This book, which also has an <a href="http://www.astroml.org">accompanying python module called AstroML</a>, introduces the reader to sophisticated statistics, data mining, and machine learning techniques to analyze large data sets in astrophysics. Heliophysics can be be considered a specialized subset of astrophysics, so many of the methods described in this book are relevant.</li>
