<p>Relativistic electrons in Earth's outer radiation belt reach megaelectron-volt (MeV) energy and pose a severe space weather threat for spaceborne electronics orbiting our planet.</p>
<p>Ideally, stakeholders such as the space industry, service providers, and government agencies, count on reliable model forecasts of MeV electrons to take necessary mitigation measures to protect their space assets.</p>
<p>In the following notebook, we show case how flux distributions of one MeV electrons can be predicted by the PreMevE model using a machine learning approach. Here we rely on scikit-learn and TensorFlow packages for model algorithim implementation.</p>
<p>The content we show is part of a bigger analysis published in the <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019SW002399">Forecasting Megaelectron‚ÄêVolt Electrons Inside Earth's Outer Radiation Belt: PreMevE 2.0 Based on Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms</a> paper.</p>
