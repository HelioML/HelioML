<p>The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory images the solar atmosphere nearly simultaneously using ten different filters in broad wavelengths ranging from 4500 Å to 94 Å, which correspond to temperatures ranging from 5000K up to 10MK (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11207-011-9776-8">Lemen et al. 2012</a>). Solar features span a vast range of temperatures -- for example, flaring regions can heat up to 10MK, while other features, such as coronal holes, remain several orders of magnitude cooler. By using near-simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of the solar corona, we can effectively constrain the temperature of localized solar features.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will introduce a deep learning approach to do this, called Differential Emission Measure (DEM) Inversion. <i>For this notebook</i>, <code>DeepEM</code> is a trained on one set of <i>SDO</i>/AIA observations (six optically-thin channels; 6 x N x N) and DEM solutions (in 18 temperature bins from logT = 5.5 - 7.2 K, 18 x N x N; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/807/2/143">Cheung et al 2015</a>) at a resolution of 512 x 512 (N = 512) using a 1x1 2D Convolutional Neural Network with a single hidden layer.</p>
<p>The <code>DeepEM</code> example presented here takes every DEM solution with no regards to the quality or existence of the solution. As will be demonstrated, when this method is trained with a single set of <i>SDO</i>/AIA images and DEM solutions, <code>DeepEM</code> solutions have a similar fidelity to Basis Pursuit (with a significantly increased computation speed—on the order of 10 million DEM solutions per second), and additionally, <code>DeepEM</code> finds positive solutions for every pixel.</p>
<p>This notebook was developed with <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a>, and <code>DeepEM</code> is currently under development on <a href="https://github.com/PaulJWright/DeepEM">Github</a>.</p>
