<p>A Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) throws magnetic flux and plasma from the Sun into interplanetary space. In fact, CMEs and solar flares are considered “a single magnetically driven event” (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012LRSP....9....3W">Webb &amp; Howard 2012</a>), wherein a flare unassociated with a CME is called a confined or compact flare. <br></p>
<p>In general, the more energetic a flare, the more likely it is to be associated with a CME (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005JGRA..11012S05Y">Yashiro et al. 2005</a>) -- but this is not, by any means, a rule. For example, <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...804L..28S">Sun et al. (2015)</a> found that the largest active region in the last 24 years produced 6 X-class flares but not a single observed CME.<br></p>
<p>In the following notebook, we will be predicting whether or not a flaring active region will also emit a CME using a machine learning algorithm from the scikit-learn package called a Support Vector Machine.</p>
<p>The analysis that follows is published in <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...821..127B">Bobra &amp; Ilonidis, 2016, <i> Astrophysical Journal</i>, 821, 127</a>.</p>
