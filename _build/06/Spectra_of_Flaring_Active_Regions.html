<p>In this chapter we will explore how the spectral line associated with once ionized Magnesium (Mg II) behaves during a solar flare. To do this, we will make use of one of the most celebrated classical machine learning algorithms known as the k-means algorithm, to conjointly analyze slit-jaw images (SJI) and spectra collected by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS).</p>
<p>This chapter draws heavily on the functionality provided by <a href="https://github.com/i4Ds/IRISreader">IRISreader</a>, a library constructed for the purposes of supporting machine learning exploration on data collected by IRIS. The contents presented in this chapter are hosted on <a href="https://github.com/Brandonleighpanos/k-means-analysis-of-MgII-spectra">Github</a> and are reflections of the publication <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aac779/meta">Panos et al, 2018, ApJ, 806, 14 </a>.</p>
