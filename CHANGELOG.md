## [Unreleased]

### Added
* environment.yml file for each chapter. This allows each chapter to define the versions of every package they depend on, particularly in cases where different chapters use different versions of the same package. 

### Changed

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed

## [v0.3.0](https://github.com/HelioML/HelioML/releases/tag/v0.3.0)

### Added 
* Chapters 4-6

### Removed
* Interactivity directly in the online book. The reasons for this are that 1) most chapters require significant processing resources/time, which doesn't play well with, for example, Binder, and 2) Using Google Cloud Platform or equivalent costs money and this project is presently unfunded.

## [v0.2.0](https://github.com/HelioML/HelioML/releases/tag/v0.2.0)

### Added
* Chapter 3

## [v0.1.0](https://github.com/HelioML/HelioML/releases/tag/v0.1.0)

### Added
* Chapters 1-2
